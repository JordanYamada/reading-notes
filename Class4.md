##### Notes to Self:

- Wireframing allows you to build the foundation without losing track of the initial design.
- HTML is where you lay the foundation of the webpage.
- You can add content to the page, but you have limited means to modify its layout.
- The h1 element should be at the top of the page.
- The semantic element that is use to wrap around a text will give that text its meaning.
- Image elements are self-contained and do not need a closing element.
