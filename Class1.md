##### Notes to Self:
- **Don't** forget the **SPACE**!!!
- Capitalization **does** matter when adding a relative link
- You can add an image following these steps: **!**, a bracketted description of what the image is, then the image link nested in parenthesis.
- If you follow the previous steps, but exclude the **!**, you'll make a link, instead.
- You can have multiple headers of various degrees. The number of pound-signs show the decrementing degree. 
- You can make numbered(ordered) list by simply starting a line the number, 1, and having the following entries starting with the next numbers in sequential order.
