##### Notes to Self:
- A **Text Editor** allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a web site. 
- They may be downloaded and installed to your system or be accessed from a browser.
- The choice of text editor comes down to user's preference.
- The most important features are: 
> 1. Code completion 
> 2. Syntax highlighting
> 3. A nice variety of themes (to reduce eye strain and fatigue)
> 4. The ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them
- Code completion offers possible possible code suggestions as you type, saving you time and preventing possible errors.
- Syntax highlighting colorizes your text based on what its data property is. This allow the code to be easier to read.
