##### Notes to Self:
- A **Text Editor** allows you to write and manage text, especially the text that you write to build a web site. 
- They may be downloaded and installed to your system or be accessed from a browser.
- The choice of text editor comes down to user's preference
- The most important features are: 
> 1.) code completion
2.) syntax highlighting
3.) a nice variety of themes to reduce eye strain and fatigue
4.) the ability to choose from a healthy selection of extensions available when you need them.
- Code completion offers possible possible code sugguestions as you type, saving you time and preventing possible errors.
- Syntax highlighting colorizes your text based on what its data property is. This allow the code to be easier to read.
