##### Notes to Self:
 -  *Git* and *GitHub* are **not** the same.
 -  Git = version control
 -  GitHub = where you can share files
 -  Repository = folder/directory that is tracked with Git
 -  Generally one project will have a single repository, but larger progects may have more.
 -  Repositories may live in your computer, GitHub, or both.
 -  Git allows you to work offline while keeping track of changes made.
