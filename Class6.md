##### Notes to Self:
- *JavaScript* and *Java* are **not** the same.
- JS allows you to add complex an non-static things to web pages, such as: time displays, interactive maps, animated graphics...
- API= Application Programming Interfaces= ready-made sets of code building blocks that help you implement things that may be difficult or impossible.
- You can think of APIs as similar to pre-fabricated furniture.The larger pieces are already may, you just have put it all together to work.
- Because code is generally loaded in the order it appears on the page, errors may pop up if JS is loaded and run before HTML and CSS that it was intended to modify.
- JS runs from top-to-bottom, so if you code to modify and object before it is referenced, you will get an error.
