##### Notes to Self:
- Just going list a few operators as a Cheat Sheet here...
- Assignment	 (=) f()	x = f()
- Addition assignment	(+=)	x = x + f()
- Subtraction assignment	(-=)	x = x - f()
- Multiplication assignment	(*=)	x = x * f()
- Division assignment	(/=)	x = x / f()
- Remainder assignment	(%=)	x = x % f()
- Exponentiation assignment	(**=)	x = x ** f()
- 
- Equal (==)
- Not equal (!=)
- Strict equal (===) - operands must be the equal **AND** the same data type
- Strict not equal (!==)operands must be *not* equal **OR** are *not* the same data type
- Greater than (>)
- Greater than or equal (>=)
- Less than (<)
- Less than or equal (<=)
- Remainder (%)
- Increment (++) - If used as a prefix operator (++x), returns the value of its operand after adding one; if used as a postfix operator (x++), returns the value of its operand before adding one.
- Decrement (--) same as about but in subtraction
- Unary negation (-) subtraction
- Unary plus (+) addition
- Exponentiation operator (**)  
-  AND	(a && b) compares two expressions to see if **both** are true
-  OR (a || b) compares two expressions to see if **either** are true
-  Not (!a)

- A *While Loop* will repeat a code until an expression is true.
- This means a while loop could continue infinitely; breaking the code.
- A * For Loop* will only repeat the amount of times the code specifies.
